# Purge Bad Zips

## Overview
This is a very simple command line app written in pure Python3 to test all the zip files in a directory (recursivly) and either just report or purge the damaged files.

It's something that can be done with an oversized oneliner but I thought I would take the practice and time to write up a proper script since it's something I find myself needing to check more than a little. I made this for auditing my massive collections of compressed roms, since corrupted ZIP files can be a pain.

If you find any use of this or want a feature let me know.

## Versions

    * First Posted version.
    * Fully functional.
    * I want to write a slightly cleaner version with more reusable code.
